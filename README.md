Heavily inpired by the Love Running walkthrough, the navigation bar is featured on all pages and with responsive design. It is consistent throughout the whole website. 

For example, on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, the home page would look like this unexpanded:

## Design

The website sports a modern iOS-inspired aesthetic with silver and grey tones. It features:
- A collage of background images sourced from Pexels.
- A consistent use of an RGBA colour scheme (211, 211, 211, 0.900) for most sections, adding a blur effect with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`.
- Dark grey text (`color: rgba(56, 56, 56, 1)`) across the website, with white text in the testimonials section to enhance readability.

Initial sketches were created using Samsung Notes to conceptualise the layout and interface of the website.

## User Experience

Visitors to the website are guided through a seamless journey where they can learn about Irene Lodi, explore the services offered, view recommended dental products, read testimonials from other patients, and make enquiries directly through the contact page.

## Technologies Used

- **DALL-E 3**: Used to generate the initial tooth image for the Smiles by Irene logo.
- **Paint.net & PowerPoint**: Tools for extensive editing of the logo and other images.
- **Canva**: Used to create visual content for the `meetirene.html` page.
- **Visual Studio Code with Live Server**: Enabled real-time testing and viewing of the website during development.
