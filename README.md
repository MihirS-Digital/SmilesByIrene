# Smiles By Irene

Welcome to the official website of "Smiles By Irene," a dedicated platform for dental hygiene and therapy managed by Irene Lodi. This site is crafted to serve a diverse audience including patients, dental professionals, and dental students, providing a comprehensive look into Irene's practice and the broader field of dental care.

## Introduction

The "Smiles By Irene" website is designed to be a central hub for engaging with the services offered by Irene Lodi, a seasoned Dental Hygienist and Therapist. It provides valuable information on various dental procedures, access to recommended dental products, and direct communication with Irene through an enquiry form.

## Website Structure

The website consists of several key pages:

- **Home Page (`index.html`)**: The starting point of the website, introducing visitors to the site.
- **Meet Irene (`meetirene.html`)**: Detailed background on Irene Lodi, her qualifications, experience, and professional goals.
- **My Services (`services.html`)**: Information on services provided, ranging from Gum Disease Treatment to Dental Restorations & Airflow, coupled with educational content about these procedures.
- **Dental Products (`dentalproduct.html`)**: A curated selection of dental products recommended by Irene, featuring links to purchase these items through Amazon wish lists.
- **Testimonials (`testimonials.html`)**: Reviews and experiences shared by patients.
- **Blog (`blog.html`)**: Currently under construction, this section will feature articles and updates from Irene.
- **Contact (`contact.html`)**: Contains a form for direct enquiries and links to Irene's social media profiles on Instagram and LinkedIn.

## Design

The website sports a modern iOS-inspired aesthetic with silver and grey tones. It features:
- A collage of background images sourced from Pexels.
- A consistent use of an RGBA colour scheme (211, 211, 211, 0.900) for most sections, adding a blur effect with `backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`.
- Dark grey text (`color: rgba(56, 56, 56, 1)`) across the website, with white text in the testimonials section to enhance readability.

Initial sketches were created using Samsung Notes to conceptualize the layout and interface of the website.

## User Experience

Visitors to the website are guided through a seamless journey where they can learn about Irene Lodi, explore the services offered, view recommended dental products, read testimonials from other patients, and make enquiries directly through the contact page.

## Technologies Used

- **DALL-E 3**: Used to generate the initial tooth image for the Smiles by Irene logo.
- **Paint.net & PowerPoint**: Tools for extensive editing of the logo and other images.
- **Canva**: Used to create visual content for the `meetirene.html` page.
- **Visual Studio Code with Live Server**: Enabled real-time testing and viewing of the website during development.
